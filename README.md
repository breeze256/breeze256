Hi friends!
===========

I'm a student interested in open source technology.

Philosophy
----------

I support the Free Software Movement because I believe that computer users have the right to gain free control over the software they use.

Specialized langs
-----------------

* I learned C++ for competitive contests.
* I learned the R lang for statistical calculations.
* I used to learn Rust, but was turned off by its redundant rules.
* I am familiar with front-end languages such as HTML and CSS.

Desired Learning
----------------

* Haskell, I'm interested in functional programming.
* Assembly, I want to learn about computer principles.
